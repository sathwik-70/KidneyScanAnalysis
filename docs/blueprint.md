# **App Name**: KidneyScan Analyzer

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Enable users to upload CT scan images in common formats such as DICOM, JPEG, and PNG.
- AI Condition Prediction: Leverage a pre-trained AI model tool to predict potential kidney conditions (normal, cyst, tumor, or stone) based on the uploaded CT scan image.
- Prediction Confidence Level: Generate a confidence level (percentage) for each condition predicted by the AI model tool, providing users with an understanding of the certainty behind the diagnosis.
- Explanation of Predictions: Create a brief, human-readable explanation for each prediction to help users understand why the AI arrived at a specific conclusion. If possible based on available libraries, visually highlight areas of concern on the image
- Clear Result Presentation: Display the predicted condition, confidence level, and AI's explanation clearly within the app's UI. Ensure ease of access and intuitive interpretation for users, regardless of technical background.
- Feedback and Model Improvement: Implement a secure system to log user feedback and track model prediction accuracy over time. Store non-identifiable data for internal model improvement.
- Model Performance Analytics: Incorporate charts to display key performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, for the four results.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark Blue (#204060) to evoke a sense of trust, stability, and professionalism, critical in medical applications. 
- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F4F8) provides a clean and neutral backdrop, reducing eye strain and ensuring the focus remains on the scan images and analysis results.
- Accent color: Teal (#40A0A0), an analogous color, for interactive elements such as buttons and active states to draw user attention without being distracting, while continuing to imply a link to medicine through its historic association with cleanliness and sanitation
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern, clean, and accessible look. Ensure excellent readability on screens, accommodating a wide range of users.
- Use clear and simple icons from 'lucide-react' for easy identification of functionalities (e.g., upload, analyze, feedback). The icons should maintain a consistent style and be large enough for easy recognition.
- Employ a responsive, single-column layout to ensure seamless usability on various devices. Prioritize content flow from image upload, to analysis, to results in a linear, intuitive manner.
- Incorporate subtle animations to improve user experience. Use a spinner during AI analysis to indicate loading, and a brief highlighting effect upon prediction results. Animations should be brief and functional, not distracting.
